The best way to learn how a program works is to write
that program yourself. You want to learn how servers work?
Great! Try and write one on your own! Even if you fail, 
I guarantee you will learn something out of the whole
experience. In this post, I will show you how to create your
very own server that accepts POST requests. But, I won't show you how
to create the whole thing from scratch. I will be focusing
on how to handle a POST request and return a response from the
output of a Python script.

Python already has a minimal built-in server that can handle POST requests.
