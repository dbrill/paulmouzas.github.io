<p>I created a simple Flask app that calculates your one rep max and spits out the results on the graph using several different formulas.</p>
<p><a href="http://paulmouzas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/chart.png"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/chart-1024x682.png" alt="chart" width="1024" height="682" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-135" /></a></p>
<p>It's hosted up on <a href="http://one-rep-max.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>I like Flask because it's such an easy to use framework and you can create web apps very fast with it. I may do something in Django for my next project. We'll see ;)</p>
