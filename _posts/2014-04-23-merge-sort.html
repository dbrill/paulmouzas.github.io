<p>I never actually use recursion while doing any practical programming, but I like to practice it sometimes. Part of the reason for not utilizing it is I barely know how it works sometimes. I can follow the stack diagram to a point, but eventually my brain explodes from the complexity of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to see if I could create a merge sort function with Python. I always that that this was a particularly elegant solution for sorting a list. First, I write a simple merge function that will merge two already ordered lists into one ordered list.</p>
<pre>
def merge(L1, L2):
    """ merges two ordered lists 
    into one ordered list  """
    ans = []
    while len(L1) != 0 and len(L2) != 0:
        if L1[0] <= L2[0]:
            ans.append(L1.pop(0))
        else:
            ans.append(L2.pop(0))
    if len(L1) > 0:
        ans += L1
    if len(L2) > 0:
        ans += L2
    return ans
</pre>
<p>Now, I create a mergeSort function that uses a divide and conquer strategy. Wikipedia has a great animation that shows how this works.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif" /></p>
<p>Here's my mergeSort function:</p>
<pre>
def mergeSort(L):
    """ Orders a list of unordered
    elements with recursion """
    
    #base case
    if len(L) <= 1:
        return L

    mid = len(L)/2
    left = mergeSort(L[:mid])
    right = mergeSort(L[mid:])
        
    return merge(left, right)
</pre>
<p>My base case returns L if the length of L is less than or equal to one because an empty list, or a list of one element, is technically ordered. The magic part is what happens when I call the mergeSort function on the left and right sides of the list. At this point I just take the so called "leap of faith" and trust that this is working as it's supposed to. </p>
