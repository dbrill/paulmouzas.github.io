title: Look and Say Sequence
---

Here was a fun little exerscise on Reddit's daily programmer.

>Description
>The Look and Say sequence is an interesting sequence of numbers where each term is given by describing the makeup of the previous term.
>The 1st term is given as 1. The 2nd term is 11 ('one one') because the first term (1) consisted of a single 1. The 3rd term is then 21 ('two one') because the second term consisted of two 1s. The first 6 terms are:
>1
>11
>21
>1211
>111221
>312211
>Formal Inputs & Outputs
>Input
>On console input you should enter a number N
>Output
>The Nth Look and Say number.
>Bonus
>Allow any 'seed' number, not just 1. Can you find any interesting cases?

Instead of getting the input from the console, I will just be including it in the script. And instead of returning the Nth Look and Say number, I return the entire sequence up to N.

{% highlight python %}
import unittest
from itertools import groupby

TERM = '23'
N = 10

def next_term(term):
    output = ''
    for k, g in groupby(term):
        first = str(len(list(g)))
        second = k
        output += (first + second)
    return output

def look_n_say(n, term):
    output = []
    for i in range(n):
        output.append(term)
        term = next_term(term)
    return output

class LookNSayTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.expected = ['23', '1213', '11121113', '31123113', '132112132113',
                    '11131221121113122113', '311311222112311311222113', 
                    '1321132132211213211321322113', 
                    '11131221131211132221121113122113121113222113', 
                    '3113112221131112311332211231131122211311123113322113']
        self.got = look_n_say(N, TERM)
                    
    def test_seq(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.got, self.expected)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
{% endhighlight %}

I used the groupby function in Python's itertools module to return consecutive keys and groups from the term. For example, with the term '233311':

[k for k, g in groupby('233311')] --> 2 3 1
[list(g) for k, g in groupby('233311')] --> 2 333 11
