<p>I've been having a lot of fun with Pygame lately. My latest project is a clone of Atari's classic game, Breakout. Such a simple, yet addicting game. Here's a screen shot of the game I'm working on. </p>
<p><a href="http://paulmouzas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/breakout.png"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/breakout.png" alt="breakout" width="486" height="345" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106" /></a></p>
<p>The code for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/paulmouzas/breakout">here</a>. And credit where credit is due, I borrowed some code from <a href="http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/show_file.php?file=breakout_simple.py">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14700889/pygame-level-menu-stateshttp://">here</a>.</p>
<p>The part I really had trouble with was how to change the angle of the ball's trajectory based on where the ball hits the paddle.</p>
