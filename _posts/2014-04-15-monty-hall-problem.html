<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> is something that seems so simple when explained, yet so unintuitive. I had a tougher time than I care to admit trying to simulate the Monty Hall problem in code. </p>
<p>Here is my approach:</p>
<pre>
import random

trys = 1000
door = ['goat', 'goat', 'car']
wins = 0

for i in range(trys):
    random.shuffle(door)

    if door[1] == 'goat':
        final_choice = door[2]
    else:
        final_choice = door[1]
    if final_choice == 'car':
        wins += 1
print 'Number of wins out of 1,000: ', wins
</pre>
<p>I chose a door. If that door was a goat, I chose another door (it doesn't matter which one). If it wasn't a goat, I would keep the original guess (since I know for sure it at least wasn't one of the two goats). Statistically, the number of wins should be about 2/3 the number of trys.</p>
