<p>I had an idea for a project to practice my programming chops. It is to create a name day application for a mobile phone that scans your contact information and reminds you that it is someone's name day.</p>
<p>Name days are kind of a big deal in some countries. They're celebrated kind of like birthdays are celebrated here.</p>
<p>Before I start any major project I'd like to finish up Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. I already knew quite a bit of Python before starting this series but it was a nice refresher. I also learned quite a bit, especially in the later exercises. I don't think it can hurt to take a few steps back and do some simple stuff.</p>
