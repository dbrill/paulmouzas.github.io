<p>There is a git repository on Github that contains 100 ideas for programming projects. Most of them aren't too difficult. I will occasionally do one or two projects to keep my programming skills sharp, and maybe learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to implement the Sieve of Erathosthenes from the list of projects. I followed these instructions from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).</li>
<li>Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.</li>
<li>Starting from p, enumerate its multiples by counting to n in increments of p, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; the p itself should not be marked).</li>
<li>Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Using these instructions as a guide, I translated everything to Python. I used a dictionary to keep track of the primes. Any key that had a value of False, is not a prime:</p>
{% highlight python %}
def sieve(n):
    d = dict.fromkeys(range(2,n+1), True)
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        if d[i]:
            for j in range(i*2, n+1, i):
                d[j] = False
    return [x for x in d if d[x]]
{% endhighlight %}
